      <h1>Quick background story:</h1>
      <div class="story one">
        <h2><span class="ball">1</span>I was born</h2>
        <p>on November,12 1987 in Tulungagung, East Java - Indonesia. It's an extremely small village that I wouldn't be surprised if it's excluded on the map. Anyway, my parents moved to Surabaya since I was an infant. That's where I lived till I was about 17 yo.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="story two">
        <h2><span class="ball">2</span>When I was 17</h2>
        <p>I was lucky enough to get a scholarship &amp; moved to the Netherlands. Not that simple tho, lots of drama involved - mom cried like I was dead. Oh anyway - I buried my dream to study in Canada since (darn you destiny!)</p>
        <p>Not true, I am still considering to do that sometime in the future actually. Like when one of my great-great ancestors got really really rich from a lottery and died.
        shit, why am I being so mean?! I love my family - forget bout my last comment.
        Move on..</p>
      </div>

      <div class="story three">
        <h2><span class="ball">3</span>And then I was 20</h2>
        <p class="note">/* Quick hint: College was boring as fuck */</p>
        <p>I moved to California (OC - LA) - started as an intern at Subset M (New media marketing company in Entertainment business). 6 months passed &amp; they hired me (woott!). I met cool friends as well as cool artists there - went to Grammy Nomination for free with Cari Reed (also known as Mrs. Mraz) :D</p>
        <p>2 things I remember:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>John Mayer's hot - he's my future husband, I'm telling you.</li>
          <li>Jonas Brothers were lame as fuck. They acted too cute, made me wanna puch'em in the face.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

        <h2><span class="ball">4</span>Kaboom! back to the Netherlands</h2>
