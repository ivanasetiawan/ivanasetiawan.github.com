    This article is a continuation of <a href="{{ "/web3/2022/09/13/what-is-blockchain.html" | relative_url }}" class="font-semibold textlink">"What is Blockchain?"</a>. I'd highly recommend you to read that first.

    So our trio, Eki, Dwi and Tri, has figured out a way to secure their chaining blocks using cryptography, but it doesn't end there.
</p>
<p class="mb-4 md:mb-6">
    The trio realised early on that it doesn't matter how secure and tamper-proof the protocol is. If this data only has one source of truth, they would be fucked anyway if the computer is lost or hacked.
</p>
<p class="mb-4 md:mb-6">
    Hm... What if many computers have identical data? Yes! Peer-to-peer network should do the job!
</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 md:mt-9 md:mb-6">Peer to peer!</h2>
<p class="mb-4 md:mb-6">
    Blockchain is stored in an extensive network of computers called a peer-to-peer network. On this network, we call each computer a node and every node has a copy of the blockchain.
</p>
<p class="mb-4 md:mb-6">
    In the case of Eki, Dwi, and Tri, imagine that their chaining blocks of data are not just available on one person's computer but on many more computers.
