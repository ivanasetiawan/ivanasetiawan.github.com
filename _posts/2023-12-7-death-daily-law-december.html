    Some people say that "Death" is our greatest fear. Is it yours?
</p>
<p class="mb-4 md:mb-6">
    In his inspiring Stanford commencement speech, Steve Jobs touched our souls, noting that even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die.
    Yet, death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it, and that is as it should be because death is very likely the single best invention of life
</p>
<p class="mb-4 md:mb-6">
    Consider this — you could die today. Your friends, lovers, parents, pets could die today. Young, physically healthy people die all the time. In fact, <a class="textlink" href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/why-mortality-for-young-americans-is-increasing-at-an-alarming-rate" target="_blank">mortality for young Americans is increasing at an alarming rate</a>.
</p>
<p class="mb-4 md:mb-6">
    When you truly understand this, everything you experience will be more intense and meaningful. You will appreciate the people around you and every moment on a higher level.
    Because in the face of death, almost every-meaningless-things: pride, fear, ego, anger, just fade away... leaving only what truly matters. Whatever that is, everyone is different.
</p>

<p class="mb-4 md:mb-6">
Life is like standing at the shore of a vast, dark, ocean. You feel the fear of that dark ocean, the unpredictable and unapologetic nature, makes you want to turn away and retreat.
I want you to get into your tiny-little boat and go into that ocean and explore it. Because, in confronting the vast unknown, life becomes an exploration filled with richness and meaning.
