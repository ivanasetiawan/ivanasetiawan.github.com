        <p>on November,12 1987 in Tulungagung, East Java - Indonesia. It's an extremely small village that I wouldn't be surprised if it's excluded on the map. Anyway, my parents moved to Surabaya since I was an infant. That's where I lived till I was about 17 yo.</p>

        <h2><span class="ball"><span>2</span></span>When I was 17</h2>
        <p>I was lucky enough to get a scholarship &amp; moved to the Netherlands. Not that simple tho, lots of drama involved - mom cried like I was dead. Oh anyway - I buried my dream to study in Canada since (darn you destiny!)</p>
        <p>Not true, I am still considering to do that sometime in the future actually.. You never know, I might win a lottery or something...</p>
