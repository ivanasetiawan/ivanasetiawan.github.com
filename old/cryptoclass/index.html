      <h1 class="block__title">Why</h1>
      <div class="block__content">
        <p>
          Because it is important. Because knowledge is power. And because your future depends on it. 
          Yes you read it correctly, you should care about crypotocurrency the same way you should care about politics and the internet.
        </p>
        <blockquote cite="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/19444-just-because-you-do-not-take-an-interest-in-politics">
          “Just because you do not take an interest in politics doesn't mean politics won't take an interest in you.”

        <p>
          Bitcoin has indeed a larger market cap than many national currencies with lower volatility, 
          and even though I find that this reason is more than enough to start caring about its hype, 
          I'd like to encourage you to digg deeper into the technology behind it, as well as the <strong>why</strong> it grows so rapidly.
        </p>

        <p>
          But hey! My neighbour Jack told me it's easy free money! Is that so? I would like to encourage you to understand the technology and understand the vision before you invest in any cryptocurrencies.
          The growth of the market is insane, 600% increase within days is not uncommon. However, you need to understand that the market is extremely volatile.
          If you're not experienced in the technology or the vision, losing money is easier than earning.
        </p>

        <p>
          I believe that this is just the beginning, it's not too late to learn about cryptocurrency. 
          I see a lot of similarities between cryptocurrency &amp; the internet. 
          It will spread in adoption, grow organically &amp; continue to have utility so long as 
          the value is non-zero, which at this point seems inevitable.
          <br><br>
          I mean seriosly, you wouldn't tell anyone that it's pointless or too late to learn about the internet, would you?
